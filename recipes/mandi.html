        <h3>Description</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Mandi has become one of Saudi Arabia's most cherished dishes. The name 'Mandi' comes from the Arabic word 'nada,' which translates to 'dew,' representing the tender, dew-like texture of the meat. This method of preparation, where the meat and rice are slowly cooked in a tandoor (a hole dug in the ground and covered), dates back centuries and illustrates the innovative adaptations of Saudi cuisine to the harsh desert environment.</p>
    <p>It highlights the significant role that meat, especially lamb, plays in the Saudi culinary landscape.</p>
